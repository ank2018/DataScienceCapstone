Coursera Data Science Capstone Project designed to predict the next word, using natural language processing.This is a collaboration between professors at John Hopkins University and SwiftKey.

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. This uses natural language processing to predict the next word.

There are two parts.

Create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers.Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
Use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.
